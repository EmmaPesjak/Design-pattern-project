# Project Report
Emma Pesjak

## Environment & Tools
The project was performed on a Windows 10 PC with IntelliJ version 2022.2.3, Java version openjdk 17.0.2, maven version
3.8.5, and Git version 2.33.0.windows.2.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the course's learning
objectives. Specifically, to create an event-driven application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using 
Java Swing. The goal was to achieve a grade as high as possible and thereby showcase the utilization of the
Swing library and implement a range of different layouts and components. Furthermore, to incorporate the use of 
Streams API and to use concurrent synchronized processes in an atomic fashion. Lastly also to demonstrate the 
use of design patterns. While having the entire code structured according to the Model View Controller (MVC) 
pattern, also incorporating the observer, object pool, producer/consumer, factory method, abstract factory,
and template method patterns.

## Procedures
problem: concurrent modificationexception men jag hade tagi en vanlig deque till min weapons list, att använda
en blockig queue fixade alla problem.

problem that occured: mosterna ritas inte ut, någon form av race condition?? efersom de randomas fram.
fixades med revalidate/repaint i updatePanel()

lägger in allt som kan ändras i spelet i constants för att det ska finnas på ett ställe och vara lätt
har dock namnen på monsterna i sina klasser

problem: duplicate images could not be displayed since the Jlabel was created in Constants interface,
by instead only setting it to imageicons and making new labels when needed this was fixed

egna button och panel klasser för att spara massa rader kod eftersom alla bakgrunder är likadana och
alla butttons är likadana.

generell kodstruktur
lite om mvc

streams api lades under model

lägg patterns i någon bra ordning sen
### Producer/consumer


![](ProducerConsumerUML.png)


producer/consumer: heal/damage theads
synch/concurrent processes


### Observer
![](ObserverUML.png)

observer: vaelarya

notera att controller i UML innehåller fler (metoder)/interna klasser som inte är representerade i UMLen 
men som inte har med observer att göra


### Object pool
Object pool: dragon weapons/distributor
![](ObjectPoolUML.png)


### Factory method
Factory pattern: monsters/unicorns

### Abstract factory
Abstract factory: characterfactory

### Template method
Template pattern: the views
här kom alla swingkomponents in

Perspective: How can the results (solution) be reproduced?
What kind of problems emerged and how were these resolved?

This section is the study's methodology, which needs to account for HOW the results has been produced.
I have to say most of you do have a pretty solid understanding of this section, but try to only 
include relevant information. The reader should be able to create a similar result based on the 
contents of this section, so the focus should be on information which are relevant for reproducibility.
Think in terms of a baking recipe, where you present the steps needed in order to produce a delicious 
cake. However, don't take this metaphor too far. We need to find the information presented in cohesive
paragraphs, not segmented into separate bullet points.

There's no need to repeat implementation details in this section, unless it's absolutely crucial for 
the context. We already have full access to the results, and here we only want to see how to produce it. 
Focus on the matters which objectively should matter to the reader, not details which was only relevant 
to you. Sure, you had to study reading material and look up something on Google, but you wouldn't need 
to do that in order to reproduce the results. Emphasise the challenges which arose during construction, 
how these manifested themselves and how they were resolved in the end. Try to include some justification 
for approaches, just enough to give the reader a context, but leave analysis for the discussion.

## Discussion

kunda ha delat upp model i de olika levels? särskilt om man har mer avancerade levels.

svårast att få till mvc ordentligt...

hade det varit ett större spel hade man kunnat dela in main model mer på olika levels.

snacka om att det är bra med att ha alla konstanter på ett ställe, att man kanske även kan lägga in alla 
strängar här, så det endast är ett ställe att uppdatera på om man gör ändringar i spelet.
notera att man inte kan ge vaelarya hur mycket hälsa som helst eller göra ordlistan för lång utan att fucka UIt.

hade velat göra något större med mer user interaction men hade inte tid?

Perspective: Has the purpose been fulfilled? Determine the suitability of the implementation...
should alternative approaches and procedures be considered?
Personal reflections: What did you learn? What did you find to be particularly difficult? Did the
learning module(s) prepare you sufficiently for the challenge? What could be improved in regards to
the assignment? Etc.

So we have finally arrived at the final section, and arguable the most important in terms of evaluation. 
The content you place here will tie all aspects of the study together in a nice bundle of logic cake. 
The two most important things we need in this section regards analyses of both success and implementation.
Has the purpose been fulfilled, and to what extent has it been successful? Remember to argue for such
success on the basis of actual results. The reader needs to be able to run the thread of logic
backwards from conclusion to its source in the results, so remember to maintain objectivity. 
If the statements leading to the conclusion contains any trace of subjectivity (I think... 
I believe... I feel... etc) it will remove all scientific value, rendering your reasoning void 
of substance.

Was the approaches and procedures suitable? Only the methodology is considered here, and we expect 
to see some dissection of the actual procedures. At this point in time you have already conducted 
the study and should possess more knowledge in comparison to what you had in the beginning. If you 
or someone else were to redo this study, what should be done differently?

Personal reflections
As a finale it's always nice to see your personal reflections at the end of the discussion section. 
This can be completely subjective and regard the assignment, or the learning modules in general. 
As examiner I cannot evaluate correctness regarding these aspects since they represent your personal 
opinions, so they offer no scientific value. But I do read your reflections and appreciate the input 
and perspective you offer. While planning for future updates and changes I often get inspired by the 
feedback my students has provided.
